Cubic Spline Interpolation
Cubic spline interpolation is a special case for Spline interpolation that is used very often to avoid the problem of Runge's phenomenon. This method gives an interpolating polynomial that is smoother and has smaller error than some other interpolating polynomials such as Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial.
